# TryingPsi4andMore
A series of notebooks and python code in development as I explore using RDKit/PSI4/py3Dmol to replace my usual MacMolPlt/GamessUS workflow. 

The goal is to develop interactive python notebooks for students where all the tools can be installed via Conda. I wish to avoid all the technical issues that installing gamessUS can involve on a student's personal computer.
