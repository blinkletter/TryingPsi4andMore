    "\n",
    "We now have a ```Molecule``` object that describes an initial geometry of water. If we are close to the true structure of water, we will have a clear downhill \"slope\" in energy toward the lowest energy structure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization works by calculating the derivative of the energy function for the nuclei and electrons in the current geometry using the math of quantum chemistry. This derivative defines and energy gradient for each atom. The program then moves each atom along that gradient. We now have a new geometry that is hopefully lower in energy. Now we repeat the whole process again and obtain another geometry that is hopfully lower in energy again. Eventually the gradient (and the required movements of atoms) is so small that we start going back and forth. We have reached the bottom of the energy well and are now vibrating. We should stop now. When the energy gradient from a calculation reaches a set tolerance value the program will halt.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the energy and the gradient are calculated will not be discussed here. We will revisit this subject briefly when we discuss energy and wavefunctions in the next notebook. For now, be aware that the choice of method (Hartee-Fock, Self-Consistent Field Theory, dentity Functional Theory, etc.) and the choice of mathematical model for atomic orbitals (the \"basis set\") will decide the accuracy and the cost of your calculations.\n",

    "*Psi4* has a set of \"driver\" programs that will perform multistep calculations for us and report the results along the way in the output file. The driver that we will use is the ```psi4.optimize()``` function. As stated above, the method and basis set must be chose. there are several other imprtant variables that can be set as we prepare to optimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the ```psi4.set_options()``` function to set a group of options for our optimization. We need to pass a dictionary of the option labels and corresponding values into the function. Consider the code below.\n",

    "We have taken a molecule and determined it energy before and after optimization using the ```psi4.energy()``` function and the psi4.optimize() functions. We have seen how to access the energies and geometries of every step in the optimization using the ```return_history``` flag and how to get the wavefunction data using the ```return_wfn``` flag. We have calculated vibrational data of the optimized structure using the ```psi4.fequency()``` function.\n",

    "*ChimeraX* with the *SeqCrow* plugin can read the output file and visualize the molecule, its vibrational vectors and orbitals. *Avogadro* can read the *fchk* file and present the orbitals. If you want to go hard-core, *MultiWFN* can analyze the output data and present detailed information about the electronic structure of a given geometry. There are many more tools to try as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now obtain the minimized structure for a molecule (in gas phase) and then examine it and comment on the reasons for the given steric arrangement. But what if we want to explore a structure other than the lowest energy case? for example, we may want to examine ethan in the *anti* configuration, or cyclohexane in its \"boat but not twist-boat\" form. We may also want to catch a reaction in the act and model the transition state. To do this we must now consider how to constrain elements of the geometry. That is our next topic."
